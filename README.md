# Course Outcome
CO1: Analyze algorithms and to determine algorithm correctness and time efficiency class.

CO2: Implement abstract data type (ADT) and data structures for given application.

CO3: Design algorithms based on techniques like brute -force, divide and conquer, greedy, etc.).

CO4: Solve problems using algorithmic design techniques and data structures.

CO5: Analyze of algorithms with respect to time and space complexity.

# Problem Statements 
1. Searching and Sorting -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Consider a student database of SEIT class (at least 15 records). Database contains different fields of 
every student like Roll No, Name and SGPA.(array of structure)
a) Design a roll call list, arrange list of students according to roll numbers in ascending order (Use 
Bubble Sort)
b) Arrange list of students alphabetically. (Use Insertion sort)
c) Arrange list of students to find out first ten toppers from a class. (Use Quick sort)
d) Search students according to SGPA. If more than one student having same SGPA, then print list 
of all students having same SGPA.
e) Search a particular student according to name using binary search without recursion. (all the

SE (Information Technology) Syllabus (2019 Course) 33
student records having the presence of search key should be displayed)
(Note: Implement either Bubble sort or Insertion Sort.)

2. Stack -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Implement stack as an abstract data type using singly linked list and use this ADT for conversion of 
infix expression to postfix, prefix and evaluation of postfix and prefix expression.

3. Circular Queue -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Implement Circular Queue using Array. Perform following operations on it.
a) Insertion (Enqueue)
b) Deletion (Dequeue)
c) Display
(Note: Handle queue full condition by considering a fixed size of a queue.)

4. Expression Tree -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Construct an Expression Tree from postfix and prefix expression. Perform recursive and nonrecursive In-order, pre-order and post-order traversals.

5. Binary Search Tree -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Implement binary search tree and perform following operations:
a) Insert (Handle insertion of duplicate entry)
b) Delete
c) Search
d) Display tree (Traversal)
e) Display - Depth of tree
f) Display - Mirror image
g) Create a copy
h) Display all parent nodes with their child nodes
i) Display leaf nodes
j) Display tree level wise
(Note: Insertion, Deletion, Search and Traversal are compulsory, from rest of operations, perform 
Any three)

6. Threaded Binary Tree -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Implement In-order Threaded Binary Tree and traverse it in In-order and Pre-order.

7. Graph: Minimum Spanning Tree -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Represent a graph of your college campus using adjacency list /adjacency matrix. Nodes should 
represent the various departments/institutes and links should represent the distance between them. 
Find minimum spanning tree
a) Using Kruskal’s algorithm.
b) Using Prim’s algorithm.

8. Graph: Shortest Path Algorithm -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5
Represent a graph of city using adjacency matrix /adjacency list. Nodes should represent the various

SE (Information Technology) Syllabus (2019 Course) 34
landmarks and links should represent the distance between them. Find the shortest path using 
Dijkstra's algorithm from single source to all destination.

9. Heap Sort -- CO1, CO2, CO4
Implement Heap sort to sort given set of values using max or min heap.

10. FILE Handling -- CO1, CO3, CO5
Department maintains student’s database. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. 
Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain student data. It should allow the 
user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular student. If record of 
student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If student record is found it should 
display the student details.
